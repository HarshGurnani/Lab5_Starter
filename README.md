1. I would use unit tests to test the message feature of a messaging application. It could be possible to simulate two users within the test, and see if messages are sent correctly. Furthermore, simple tests could help determine if the system can handle errors, such as when the recipient cannot receive any new messages.
2. Yes, I would use unit tests to test the maximum message length feature. With writing tests that just simulate one users, we can check the basic functionality of what happens when a message longer or shorter tha 80 characters is sent (including boundary cases such as exactly 80 characters). Again, like the previous question, we can test error handling with tests.
